# TEOProxy

**TEOProxy** is a custom cross-chain oracle proxy contract designed to connect a consumer‚Äôs smart contract to Band Protocol‚Äôs TssVerifier via a specific oracle script. In your setup:

1. **Oracle Script**: The logic for fetching and formatting data lives in the Band Protocol oracle script: [https://band-v3-testnet.cosmoscan.io/oracle-script/14#code](https://band-v3-testnet.cosmoscan.io/oracle-script/14#code)
2. **Consumer Contract**: Your on-chain consumer implements a simple interface (e.g. [`MockConsumer.sol`](src/mocks/MockConsumer.sol)) that calls into TEOProxy and only accepts validated responses.
3. **TssVerifier**: Proofs submitted through TEOProxy are verified against Band Protocol‚Äôs TssVerifier: [https://github.com/bandprotocol/tunnel-tss-router-contracts/blob/main/src/TssVerifier.sol](https://github.com/bandprotocol/tunnel-tss-router-contracts/blob/main/src/TssVerifier.sol)

This repo contains:

* The TEOProxy Solidity contracts (`src/TEOProxy.sol`, mocks, interfaces, tests)
* A Python 3 relayer (`relayer_script.py`) showcasing the full request‚Üírelay‚Üíverify‚Üífulfill loop
* Example interactions in JavaScript and Python under `src/example_interactions/`

## üì¶ Features

* **Example contracts**: This will help develop other custom oracle scripts.
* **Example relayer**: It continuously polls for new requests, fetches data from the Band oracle, and relays the signed result to the TEOProxy contract on the EVM. BandChain parameters (chain ID, RPC endpoint, gas limits) and EVM settings are located at the top of the script for easy customization.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

* **Foundry** (for compiling/deploying Solidity)
* **Python 3.10**
* An account on **BandChain** (`band-v3-testnet.bandchain.org`) with some native tokens
* An account on EVM‚Äëcompatible chain with some native tokens

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prin-r/TEOProxy.git
cd TEOProxy

# Install Solidity deps (if using Foundry)
forge install
```

### Run the Python relayer (Example interactions)

See [src/example\_interactions/README.md](src/example_interactions/README.md)             |
